# Installer

[Installer][1] is used to quickly install pre-compiled binaries from Github releases.

## Installation

```shell
(
  cd /usr/local/bin && \
  curl -s https://i.jpillora.com/installer | bash
)
```

## Config

```shell
/usr/local/bin/installer
```

```shell title="/etc/systemd/system/installer.service"
[Unit]
Description=Quickly install pre-compiled binaries from Github releases

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/installer
Restart=on-failure
ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR1 $MAINPID
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/installer.log
StandardError=inherit

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Usage

```sh
# install <user>/<repo> from github
curl https://i.jpillora.com/<user>/<repo>@<release>! | bash
```

```sh
# search web for github repo <query>
curl https://i.jpillora.com/<query>! | bash
```

*Or you can use* `wget -qO- <url> | bash`

**Path API**

* `user` Github user (defaults to @jpillora, customisable if you [host your own](#host-your-own), searches the web to pick most relevant `user` when `repo` not found)
* `repo` Github repository belonging to `user` (**required**)
* `release` Github release name (defaults to the **latest** release)
* `!` When provided, downloads binary directly into `/usr/local/bin/` (defaults to working directory)

**Query Params**

* `?type=` Force the return type to be one of: `script` or `homebrew`
    * `type` is normally detected via `User-Agent` header
    * `type=homebrew` is **not** working at the moment â€“ see [Homebrew](#homebrew)
* `?insecure=1` Force `curl`/`wget` to skip certificate checks
* `?as=` Force the binary to be named as this parameter value

## Security

:warning: Although I promise [my instance of `installer`](https://i.jpillora.com/) is simply a copy of this repo - you're right to be wary of piping shell scripts from unknown servers, so you can host your own server [here](#host-your-own) or just leave off `| bash` and checkout the script yourself.
