# :rocket: Future

Ramblings and stream of conscienceness on the future of my homelab.

## :straight_ruler: Size

I currently use a shallow full size 8U rack mounted to a wall.

In general, I like to keep the footprint small and out of way, but also accessible.

One thought is to go to a mini rack, but then I'd have to get rid of my current switch.

The other concern is the number of ports, which I like to keep connected to RJ45 ports routed to rooms in the house, althrough some are not being used.

:question: Do I disconnect the ports that I'm not using from the patch panel and figure out a solution when I need them :thinking:?

## :file_cabinet: NAS

I'd like to have some type of NAS to properly store my files as well has some kind of backup.

I currently have 5TB external drive attached to my [HP Pro desk][1], but it's not backed up in any way and not very compact.

My initial thoughts is to use 4 SSDs on a Raspberry Pi 5 using a [Radxa Penta SATA HAT][2] due to it's compactness, but
the the speeds may suffer due to the RPi's 1 Gbit speeds. :question: Do I actually need more than 1Gbit speeds :thinking:?
