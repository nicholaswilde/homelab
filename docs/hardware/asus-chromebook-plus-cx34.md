# :computer: ASUS Chromebook Plus CX34

This Chromebook is my daily driver that I use to do most of my homelabbing. It's portable and fairly powerful. Mostly,
it's used to remote into my other machines or browse the web or compose documents or email.

    OS: `Chrome OS`

    Manufacturer: `ASUS`

    Model: `CX3402CBA-DH386-WH`

## :frame_with_picture: Background

I was interested in the Chromebook when the `Cr-48` was first released by Google and I was chosen to be part of their
pilot progarm. Since then, I've used Chromebooks as my main laptop and used other OS' and systems for support.

The reason for going with a Chromebook is to use a simple OS that does the basics of browsing the web and enabling me
to SSH into other systems.

## :penguin: Penguin Terminal

I only use the built in [Penguin Terminal][1] when I'm away from my home network.

## :closed_lock_with_key: SSH Client

I use the [Secure Shell extension by Google][2] as my main SSH client to connect to all of my other machines. This client is
lightweight and syncs with my other Chrome browser sessions, which is handy.
