# :computer: Dell Studio 1537

This computer was inherited and repurposed as a Proxmox node.

Virtualization cannot be enabled and so LXCs are run on this machine.

!!! warning

    Currently, the lid needs to be open when booting the machine, even after restart. Also, the screen remains on when the lid is closed to keep the laptop awake.
