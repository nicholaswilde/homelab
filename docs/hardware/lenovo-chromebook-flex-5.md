# :computer: Lenovo ChromeBook Flex 5

This chromebook was inherited and is used when I'm away from my homelab network. I use it the same way as my [ASUS Chromebook][2].

!!! example ""

    OS: `ChromeOS`

    Manufacturer: `Lenovo`

    Model: `ChromeBook Flex 5`

    CPU: `Core i3`

    RAM: `4GB`

    Drive: `64GB`

## :frame_with_picture: Background

Unfortunately, one of the hinges was very difficult to open and so the stress from opening the screen on the hinge caused the monitor to crack.
Therefore, I'm using this chromebook in conjunction with two external monitors and an external mouse and keyboard.

## :desktop_computer: Displays

I'm using two external monitors that are connected via a [USC C to Dual DisplayPort splitter adapter][1].
