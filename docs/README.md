A repo for my homelab setup

---

## :book: Documentation

Documentation can be found [here][1].

## :framed_picture: Background

I just want to document and share my homelab setup and experiences.

My current setup is Proxmox installed on an AMD64 desktop computer, and old AMD64 laptop, a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, and a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB.

I also have an Intel NUC running Ubuntu server with Home Assistant and add ons in Docker containers.

I also have a Raspberry Pi Zero W running and NTP server.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup & Maintenance

My homelab is setup and maintained using [Ansible][5], which is documented [here][6].
