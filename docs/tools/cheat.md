# :clipboard: cheat

[`cheat`][1] allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the
command-line. It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators
of options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently
enough to remember.

I use this rather than [cheat.sh][2] because I can more easily add and edit my own cheatsheets.
