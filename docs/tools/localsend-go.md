# LocalSend Go

[LocalSend Go][1] is a command line implementation of LocalSend.

I use this app as a command line interface to interact with the mobile and [LocalSend web app][2].

!!! note

    The current version of the LocalSend web app is not compatible with the current version of LocalSend Go. See [#9][3].
