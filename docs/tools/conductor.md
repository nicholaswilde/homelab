# :material-source-branch: Google Conductor

[Google Conductor][1] is a spec-driven development framework designed to organize and automate software projects using AI agents. It prioritizes clarity, traceability, and strict adherence to project-specific conventions.

## :brain: Methodology

Conductor follows a **Spec-Driven Development** methodology. This approach ensures that every change to the project is grounded in a clearly defined specification and implemented according to a structured plan.

### Core Concepts

- **Project Context:** A centralized directory (`conductor/`) containing the project's vision, technology stack, and workflows. This serves as the "source of truth" for both human developers and AI agents.
- **Tracks:** High-level units of work (features, bug fixes, or chores). Each track is a self-contained module with its own specification, plan, and metadata.
- **Phased Implementation:** Tracks are broken down into logical phases. Each phase concludes with a verification step and a Git checkpoint, ensuring incremental and validated progress.
- **Quality Gates:** Strict criteria that must be met before any task is considered complete, including test coverage, linting, and manual verification.
