[Windows 11][2] is installed as a Proxmox VM on my [NUC][5]. I remote into it using [Apache Guacamole][4].

## :hammer_and_wrench: [Installation][1]

!!! warning

    In order for RDP to work, Windows Pro needs to be installed!

- [Download Windows 11 ISO][2] using `Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices` section.

Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO for x64 evices)
```

- [Download Windows VirtIO ISO][3]

### Install Windows

In the `Server View`, find the new VM and right click, then select `Start`. Then right click again and select `Console`.
This should bring up a window where you can view the `Monitor` of the VM. You may need to press a key on your keyboard
to boot from the CD/DVD to get started.

#### Windows Setup

Follow the first few steps of the Windows 11 Setup workflow. I recommend choosing Windows 11 Pro if you want to use
Remote Desktop in the future. Once you reach the `Install Location` page proceed to the next step to install the drivers.

#### Driver Installation

You likely will be unable to see any disks until the correct drivers are installed. Click the `Load Driver` option to
load the `virtio-win` SCSI driver. Click `Browse` and then navigate to the path \amd64\w11 and then click `OK`.

Select the `Red Hat VirtIO SCSI pass-through controller`, then click `Install`. After the driver is installed the driver
should be visible.

Click `Next` to proceed. Then `Install`. Wait for the installation to finish. It may reboot a few times. Once the
configuration workflow loads up, proceed to the `Let's connect you to a network step` then proceed to the next step.

#### Install VirtIO Drivers

Previously, only the driver to view the disks during installation was installed. Now all the drivers need to be
installed in order to have full functionality of the VM. Press `Shift + F10` to bring up the Terminal. You will need to
click the `Terminal` to bring it into focus. Then start the driver installation

!!! code

    ```
    D:\virtio-win-guest-tools.exe
    ```

Once executed, the VirtIO setup will start. Follow the installation instructions. I typically use the defaults. Once the install has finished click "Finish" and close out of the Terminal. The "Network" should now be connected. Click "Next" to proceed and complete the Windows installation as normal.

## :gear: RDP

Remote control of the W11 installation is done through Apache Guacamole.

### :simple-proxmox: Proxmox GUI

Ensure that the firewall is turned off.

!!! example ""

    `Firewall -> Options -> Firewall: No`

    `Hardware -> Network Device (net0) -> Firewall: Unchecked`

### ![windows](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/microsoft-windows.png){ width="16" } Windows

!!! example "Windows Defender Firewall"

    === "Domain Profile"

        Firewall state: `Off`
        
    === "Private Profile"

        Firewall state: `Off`
        
    === "Public Profile"

        Firewall state: `Off`
