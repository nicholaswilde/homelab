# :simple-homepage: Homepage

Homepage is my landing üõ¨ page for my most frequented sites as well as my internal web pages.

I don't show service statistics to keep things a bit cleaner and simple.

I make this my üè† button as well as my new tab in Chrome so that it launches every time I launch Chrome, open a new tab, or click the home üè† button. I use the [New Tab Redirect][2] extension to redirect my new tab to Homepage.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
