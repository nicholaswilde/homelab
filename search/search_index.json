This is used to copy the backup    archives to cloud storage. This can be installed via the <code>rclone</code> package    on Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS/Fedora (EPEL    required for RHEL/CentOS), but as rclone changes more rapidly, it's probably    best to just use the latest binary from https://rclone.org/downloads/.</p> </li> <li> <p>An account at one or more cloud storage services    supported by rclone.

In my setup, it looks like this:</p> <pre><code> /opt/vaultwarden  # Top-level Vaultwarden directory\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 backup         # This backup repo\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 data           # Vaultwarden data directory\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Copy the <code>backup.conf.template</code> file to <code>backup.conf</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you want encrypted backup archives using <code>gpg</code>, set the       <code>GPG_PASSPHRASE</code> variable accordingly. If you want to encrypt using       <code>age</code> instead, set the <code>AGE_PASSPHRASE</code> variable. If both variables are       set, only <code>gpg</code> encryption will be performed. If you don't want       encryption at all, comment out both variables or set them to be blank.</p> <p>This passphrase is used to encrypt the backup archives, which may   contain somewhat sensitive data in plaintext in <code>config.json</code> (the   password entries themselves are already encrypted by Bitwarden). It   should be something easy enough for you to remember, but complex enough   to deter, for example, any unscrupulous cloud storage personnel who   might be snooping around. As this passphrase is stored on disk in   plaintext, it definitely should not be your Bitwarden master passphrase   or anything similar.</p> <p>rclone crypt is another option for encrypted   archives. If you prefer to use this method, just set <code>GPG_PASSPHRASE</code> to   be blank, configure rclone crypt appropriately, and use the crypt remote   in <code>RCLONE_DESTS</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Change <code>RCLONE_DESTS</code> to your list of rclone destinations. You'll have       to configure rclone appropriately first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Note that <code>backup.conf</code> is simply sourced into the <code>backup.sh</code> script, so       you can add arbitrary environment variables into <code>backup.conf</code> as needed.       This can be useful for configuring any tools called from <code>backup.sh</code>,       such as <code>rclone</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modify the <code>backup/crontab.template</code> file as needed. This crontab actually    calls <code>cron.sh</code> to run the backup, rather than calling <code>backup.sh</code> directly.    Currently, <code>cron.sh</code> captures the output of the current run of <code>backup.sh</code>    to a <code>backup.log</code> file. It also saves a copy of this log file, named    according to whether the backup run was a success or failure. You can add    other custom logic to <code>cron.sh</code> if needed, such as signaling failure to a    cron monitoring service.</p> </li> <li> <p>If <code>$HOME/vaultwarden</code> isn't your top-level Vaultwarden directory, adjust       the paths in this file accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review the backup schedule. I generate backup archives hourly, but you       might prefer to do this less frequently to save space.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review the local backup archive retention policy. I delete archives       older than 14 days (<code>-mtime +14</code>). Adjust this if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review the log file retention policy. I delete log files older than       14 days (<code>-mtime +14</code>). Adjust this if needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review the SQLite VACUUM schedule,       or remove the job if you don't want vacuuming. Vacuuming compacts the       database file so that operations are faster and backups are smaller.</p> </li> <li> <p>Install the crontab under a user (typically your normal login) that can    read your Vaultwarden data. In many cases, running <code>crontab -e</code> and pasting    the contents of the filled-in crontab template file should work. Note that    if your cron user doesn't have write permissions to the database, then you    must ensure it has write permissions to the Vaultwarden data directory,    as SQLite may need to create a <code>-wal</code> file for the database if it doesn't    already exist. If it's unable to do this, the backup will fail with an    <code>attempt to write a readonly database</code> error.

Use standard Debian application practices to update the app.\n      - Can model the update script from https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts for `amd64` apps or https://pimox-scripts.com/scripts for `arm64` apps.\n\n3.  **Finalize:** Once you have updated these files, you can remove any placeholder values.\n</code></pre> <p>AGENTS.md files can also be used to enable the use of other AI agents.</p> <p>Enable <code>gemini-cli</code> to use <code>AGENTS.md</code> files.</p> <p>~/.gemini/settings.json</p> <pre><code>{ \"contextFileName\": \"AGENTS.md\" }\n</code></pre>","tags":["tools"]},{"location":"tools/google-gemini-cli/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>Once installed and authenticated, start interacting with Gemini from the shell.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli\ncd gemini-cli\ngemini\n&gt; Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday\n</code></pre> <p>Start a chat</p> <pre><code>gemini\n</code></pre> <p>Pipe content to the CLI from <code>stdin</code></p> <pre><code>echo \"Explain the content of this file docs/README.md\" | gemini -p\n</code></pre>","tags":["tools"]},{"location":"tools/google-gemini-cli/#list-models","title":"List Models","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Assuming that your Gemini key is stored in the <code>GEMINI_API_KEY</code> environmental variable and <code>jq</code> is installed.</p> <p>Code</p> <pre><code>curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}\" | jq -r '.models[].name'\n</code></pre>","tags":["tools"]},{"location":"tools/google-gemini-cli/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli</li> </ul>","tags":["tools"]},{"location":"tools/jinja2-cli/","title":"jinja2-cli","text":"<p>jinja2-cli is used as a template engine to help generate documents, such as mkdocs markdown pages or traefik config files.</p>","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/jinja2-cli/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"pipx <pre><code>pipx install jinja2-cli\n</code></pre>","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/jinja2-cli/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>Example</p> <pre><code>jinja2 .template.md.j2 -D APP_NAME=\"New App\" -D APP_PORT=8080 -D CONFIG_PATH=/opt/new-app &gt; new-app.md\n</code></pre>","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/jinja2-cli/#references","title":"References","text":"","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/localsend/","title":"LocalSend","text":"<p>LocalSend is a free and open-source cross-platform app that allows you to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over your local network without the need for an internet connection.</p>","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/localsend/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"aptbrew <pre><code>sudo apt install localsend\n</code></pre> <pre><code>brew install localsend\n</code></pre>","tags":["tool"]},{"location":"tools/localsend/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>1.
