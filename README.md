A repo for my homelab setup

---

## :book: Documentation

Documentation can be found [here][1].

## :framed_picture: Background

I just want to document and share my homelab setup and experiences.

My current setup consists of my NUC and AMD64 desktop computer running Proxmox. My Raspberry Pi 5 16GB is also running Proxmox and my Raspberry Pi 4 8GB is running Home Assistant.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup & Maintenance

My homelab is setup and maintained using [Ansible][5], which is documented [here][6].
