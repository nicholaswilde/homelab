# AI Agent Instructions (AGENTS.md)

This file serves as the primary entry point for AI agents interacting with this repository.

## Project Context & Guidelines

The comprehensive project context, technology stack, and operational workflows have been migrated to the **Conductor** documentation structure. AI agents MUST refer to these files for all development and maintenance tasks:

- **[Product Definition](conductor/product.md)**: Vision, goals, and target users.
- **[Product Guidelines](conductor/product-guidelines.md)**: Agent persona, boundaries, and style guides.
- **[Technology Stack](conductor/tech-stack.md)**: Detailed core infrastructure, automation tools, and MCP server configurations.
- **[Project Workflow](conductor/workflow.md)**: Task lifecycle, project structure, and common commands.

## Tracks and Management

- **[Tracks Registry](conductor/tracks.md)**: Overview of all major tracks and their status.
- **[Tracks Directory](conductor/tracks/)**: Detailed specifications and implementation plans for each track.
